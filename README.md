# TempuTrip

#Four scenarios:

# 1. Registration - users will make accounts and need to login every time. They will be able to view their past searches and their results when they login to their account.
# 2. Browsing - users can view the current weather on an interactive map created by D3.js.
# 3. Searching - users can search for the best place to vacate during a specific time in specific areas.
# 4. Input - users can add things to do, best times of the year, and other reviews to areas that they visit or have visited for other users to view.


# The two scenarios currently implemented are: scenraio 1 (registration), and scenario 3 (searching).
# The third implemented scenario is scenario 4 (input).
